Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images

## Aim 
Develop a system to identify and locate tumor regions in Gigapixel tissue slides to assist pathologists for detection of cancer

## Dataset 
A subset of slides and their respective tumor masks from [CAMELYON16](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/) dataset. The original slides and annotations have already been converted to a more easily usable TIF format. Every slide (and mask) file consists of images of varying zoom levels.
